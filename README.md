# title: Reach the green

A player should reach the green squarer to win

## Summary
I built random borders. If a player hits the border, the game starts again. So the player should try not hit by the border and should reach the green. 

## Component Parts
There are three components. 
A player. Random border. And a green square to reach. 

# Input / output
If you hit by the border, the crushing sound happens. 

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: 
Proposal 1- Thunderbird GAME
The bird is a mouse cursor. Thunders are coming from the sky. When they got hit by thunder ten times, they lose. When they eat coins before they got hit 10times, they win.

Proposal 2- Space invader GAME
It's a pretty simple game, but I will execute the quality design of the game visually. Not just simple shapes. but the visually pleasing design. 

Proposal 3- The 80s mood
It's not an actual game but shows some design, representing the 80s computer game. This is a short animation.

- Week 2: I changed my plan to do collecting coins game. Make a player and the player try to eat coins. 

- Week 3: I came up with an idea to reach the coins but it was too hard to create the coins. I needed to find a tutor to help create the maze because it was too hard to do on my own and the videos I saw did not help me. Most of the videos were on Javascript and not P5, so I was confused.

- Week 4: Present! Finally, I tried to create a maze with a goal. I needed to learn how to create a maze because I wanted to have a goal to win. To make it interesting, I made the maze generate a random position if you lose. You lose by touching the sides of the maze.
 
## Challenges
I wanted to make the packman player, drawing a shape by the function called pi and half pi. I successfully make the packman shape but failed to combine it with the player.
